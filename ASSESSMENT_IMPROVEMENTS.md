## Enhanced Recommendation Algorithm

### Improved Area Mapping
The recommendation engine now maps 40+ assessment areas to appropriate development plans:

**Core Leadership Areas:**
- Decision Making → Strategic Leadership, Heart of Leadership
- Communication → Communication & Influence, Team Development
- Team Development → Team Development Expert, Culture Builder

**Emotional Intelligence Areas:**
- Self-Awareness → Heart of Leadership, Communication & Influence
- Empathy → Heart of Leadership, Team Development
- Social Skills → Communication & Influence, Team Development

**Strategic Areas:**
- Strategic Planning → Strategic Leadership, Operational Excellence
- Innovation → Strategic Leadership, Operational Excellence
- Change Management → Strategic Leadership, Communication & Influence

**Performance Areas:**
- Coaching Skills → Team Development, Heart of Leadership
- Performance Management → Team Development, Operational Excellence
- Goal Setting → Team Development, Strategic Leadership

### Smart Recommendation Logic
1. **Priority Weighting** - Primary development areas get higher weight
2. **Score-Based Recommendations** - Different plans for different performance levels:
   - Very Low (< 2.5): Heart of Leadership (foundational)
   - Moderate (2.5-3.5): Team Development, Communication & Influence (practical)
   - High (≥ 4.0): Strategic Leadership, Operational Excellence (advanced)
3. **Multi-Area Analysis** - Considers all low-scoring areas, not just one
4. **Fallback Logic** - Defaults to Heart of Leadership if no specific match
